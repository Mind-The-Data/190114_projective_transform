    "Your task for the day is to write a program that simulates taking a digital photograph.  Imagine that we have a camera positioned at the origin, with a focal length of 1000 pixels and a sensor size of 2000 x 1000 pixels.  Coordinates.txt contains $p$ (point coordinates) and $I$ (intensity values) of a simulated landscape.  Use a projective transform to simulate a digital image of the landscape.  (Don't forget to crop your image to the sensor size). \n",
